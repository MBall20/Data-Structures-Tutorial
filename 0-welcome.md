# Python Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the python data structures turorial. This tutorial will not contain all the structures used, rather it will focus on the following commonly used data structures:

-[Queue](1-ques.md)
-[Linked List](2-linked_lists.md)
-[Tree](3-trees.md)

Each module will walk you through what is needed for each data structure, followed by examples. After you are taught the principle, you will be provided with a real world problem to solve. Do your best to solve it yourself and a solution will be available when you are ready to check your work.
